In this first exercise, we will study the behavior of an agent that can only see the immediately adjacent cells (that is it only sees the cells that are directly in front, behind, or on its left/right). Your agent is a simple robot that enters the maze from the bottom left cell and must reach the exit which is located on the uppermost rightmost cell. \n",

When the agent is on a cell containing a battery, it should collect it. Finally the agent can only move in the four immediately adjacent cells to its current position. When it sees no pit and there are no batteries in any of the adjacent cells, it should move at random. Consider adding on the order of 14 batteries and 18 holes (first manually, then at random) \n"

Code a Best First Search agent whose heuristic changes as it picks up new batteries. As soon as it picked up the last battery, the heuristic becomes the $\\ell_1$ distance to the exit. You can assume that the cells have unitary side length. Also recall that the $\\ell_1$ distance is given by $\\|\\boldsymbol x_1 - \\boldsymbol x_2\\|_1 = |x_{11} - x_{21}| + |x_{12} - x_{22}|$ where $\\boldsymbol x_1 = (x_{11}, x_{12})$, $\\boldsymbol x_{2} = (x_{21}, x_{22})$.    \n",
