Your agent is a simple robot that enters the maze from the bottom left cell and must reach the exit which is located on the uppermost rightmost cell. \n",

When the agent is on a cell containing a battery, it should collect it. Finally the agent can only move in the four immediately adjacent cells to its current position. When it sees no pit and there are no batteries in any of the adjacent cells, it should move at random. Consider adding on the order of 14 batteries and 18 holes (first manually, then at random) \n"

Another way of viewing this is that we iteratively perform pure hill descent, starting each descent at a random state. The end result is the best result from all descents.\n",
