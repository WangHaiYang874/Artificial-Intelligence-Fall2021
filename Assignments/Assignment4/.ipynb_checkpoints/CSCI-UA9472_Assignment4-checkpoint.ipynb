    "   - It can hit with its sword (which is essentially useful when facing the skeleton)\n",

    "   \n",
    "As you can imagine, hitting while in an empty cell is a loss of energy and should be penalized. We will thus associate useless behaviors (like hitting when alone and opening non existing doors) with a negative reward of -10. Hitting the skeleton and opening the door _when the skeleton has been killed_ should be associated with higher rewards of +30. Escaping without the kill will be associated with a negative reward of -10 (The agent should not exit before getting rid of all the evil in the room)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a total of 48 cells. Each cell can contain the skeleton, be empty or contain the door (exclusively) which makes a total of $48\\times3 = 144$ states for your environment. Moreover, we want to keep track of whether or not the skeleton has been killed so we will take into account an additional variable encoding whether the kill has been completed. This thus leads to a total of $48\\times 3\\times2 = 288$.\n",

    "#### Question 2. The parametric model (15pts)\n",
    "\n",
    "We now want to improve the generalization skills of our agent. We will encode our $Q$-table as a simple feedforward neural network. To avoid losing time with the implementation, we will rely on keras for the architecture (see below). We will consider a **simple one hidden layer** network that takes as **input** a vector encoding the current state of the environment (note that such a vector can be encoded in various ways, for example as a $5$-tuple including the cartesian coordinates of the agent and 3 variables indicating whether there is a door, skeleton,..) and returns as **output** the value associated with each of the actions. In other words we consider a parametric model $f_\\theta\\in \\mathbb{R}^{|a|}$ such that $[f_{\\theta}(s)]_a \\approx Q[s, a]$. Recall that the TD update for such a model is given\n",
